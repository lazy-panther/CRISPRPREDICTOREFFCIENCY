# CRISPRPREDICTOREFFCIENCY
about predicting Measured_PE_efficiency, a score that tells us how efficient  a DNA edit is, using a dataset with 288,793 experiments using data from DT.csv. 
The project has two approaches:
CNN Notebook (cnn_dna_prediction.ipynb): Uses a CNN model (DNAHybridModel) to analyze a DNA sequence and a few numerical features for quick predictions.
BERT Notebook (bert_crispr_prediction.ipynb): Uses a BERT-based model (CRISPRPredictor) to process two DNA sequences and more features for detailed predictions.
overall fun stuff hehe :)
